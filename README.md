# PerformanceAnalytics.jl
[![Build Status](https://github.com/eohne/PerformanceAnalytics.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/eohne/PerformanceAnalytics.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![][docs-latest-img]][docs-latest-url]   

 
Given the lack of packages that deal with financial analysis in Julia I have decided to translate the  functionality of the PerformanceAnalytics package in R to Julia.  


Since I took a long break from this and never published it a new pacakge has emergerd. This package is registered and implements many but not all of the functions available here: [PortfolioAnalytics.jl](https://github.com/doganmehmet/PortfolioAnalytics.jl)

All functions have a method definition that works with simple arrays and you can just copy past those if you want. A list of all functions can be found here: [All Functions Doc](https://eohne.github.io/PerformanceAnalytics.jl/dev/AllFunctions/)
